# Stochastic Approach To Musical Pattern Analysis

This algorithm takes midi files as input, makes pairwise comparison, and outputs a similarity score.
Then we run an experiment to validate results.

Abstractâ€”The issue of music plagiarism, intentional or acci- dental, has been a controversy within the music industry as a result of juries with limited music knowledge making decisions. A new way to make better decisions in similar court cases is by using a mathematical algorithm as a supplement to human perception. This new algorithm utilizes transition matrices to analyze similarity in musical patterns. In this paper, the transition matrix is defined based on the song notes. The algorithm derives the respective transition matrices from two or more pieces of music and then uses matrix analysis to compare them. The similarity between two songs is then discussed using sums and norms. A computer program is made in Java to model the algorithm and make the calculations. Finally, experiments are performed using the program and the significance of the results is validated using statistical analysis.
